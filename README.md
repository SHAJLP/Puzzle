THE QUIZ

This assignment I was tasked with creating a quiz, using a timer.

The user would be presented with a question and multiple choice answers.  The timer starts with 75seconds and starts counting down once the user begins quiz.  
Whichever answer the user selects, it will then move them onto the next question.
If, however, the user has selected the wrong answer, then LOSE 10 seconds off the timer!

Once the quiz has come to an end the user can enter their initials and it will be displayed on the leaderboard.  
The user has the option to reset the game and replay if they so wish.
