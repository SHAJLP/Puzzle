Code quiz challenge
I was set a task to create a quiz which the user would be asked a question which they can answer with  multiple choice answers.
The quiz itself would include a timer, which would not only countdown, but the user would lose ten second of the time if they answered incorrectly.
Once an answer is selected, the next question would load until the user has answered all the questions or the timer has run out.
The user is then able to enter their initials and upload their score to the leaderboard.
Once that has been done, the user can reset the game to play again.
